This is an android application that allows users to register and add friends that they have. <br>
They can add a friend's info consisting of their name, their DoB, their closeness level, email, phone number, as well as if they would like to be "marked" as a friend they would like to talk to more. <br>
Each friend can have up to three Interests and three Communication Methods by which to contact them by. <br>
You can create, delete, update and delete Users, Friends, and Interests (Interest deletion is handled when friends are deleted).<br>
This application lacks some features that I had planned, and overall this assignment was a learning experience in how to manage a project and not allow feature creep.<br>
It also taught me that I need to manage time better and plan out applications even more in advance than I anticipated.<br>
Additionally, I learned a lot about Database design and what to do and what not to do. My database was flawed, mainly with the tables handing Interests and Comm Methods. I will have to create more projects handling larger databases.
